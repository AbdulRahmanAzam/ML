## Classifier Assumptions – Summary
  
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Assumes that closer points have similar labels.
- Sensitive to feature scaling; distance-based.
- Assumes no strong noise/outliers.
  
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Assumes data can be separated with a hyperplane (linearly or through kernels).
- Sensitive to feature scaling.
- Assumes relatively clean data without heavy overlap.
  
Decision Trees
- Makes no linearity assumption.
- Assumes enough data to avoid overfitting.
- Insensitive to feature scaling.
  
Random Forest
- Assumes trees trained on different subsets reduce variance.
- No assumption of linearity.
- Assumes enough trees lead to stable predictions.
